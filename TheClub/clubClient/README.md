# CMUBTG Clubs
Rapidly onboard new members at the Activities Fair with CMUBTG Clubs. Given an Andrew ID, the system scrapes the CMU Directory to fetch the corresponding member's name, major, and graduation year. The information is inserted into a structured table and can be exported for use in other roster management applications.

This web application was developed for student organizations at Carnegie Mellon University.
